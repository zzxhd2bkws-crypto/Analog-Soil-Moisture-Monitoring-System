# Analog Soil Monitoring and Alert Subsystem
**Part of the Smart Plant Care Collaborative System**

## Project Context
This project was developed as part of a multi-team engineering initiative to build a fully automated Plant Care System. The overall system comprised four integrated subsystems:
1. **Sensing & Alerts (My Team):** Soil moisture monitoring and acoustic alarm generation.
2. **Irrigation Control:** Automated water pump logic.
3. **Environment Monitoring:** Light and ambient temperature sensing.
4. **Power Management:** System-wide power distribution.

## My Individual Contribution
As the **Lead Analog Designer** for the Sensing & Alert subsystem, I was responsible for:
- **Analog Signal Conditioning:** Translating physical soil parameters into stable voltage levels.
- **Alarm Generation:** Designing a custom analog oscillator to provide acoustic feedback.
